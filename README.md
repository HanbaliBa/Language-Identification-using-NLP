# Language Identification System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a language identification system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify the language of given text samples. The system is designed to preprocess text data, extract features, and classify the text into various languages.

## Features

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Feature extraction using Count Vectorization
- Language classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm
- High accuracy (approximately 92.34%) on test data

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `nltk` for NLP tasks
  - `sklearn` for machine learning
  - `joblib` for saving the model
